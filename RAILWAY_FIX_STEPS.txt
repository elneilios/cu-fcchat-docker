# Railway Fix - Manual Database Addition

Since Railway only deployed the web service, you need to manually add the MySQL database:

## Steps to Fix:

1. In Railway Dashboard, click on your project
2. Click 'New' or '+' button 
3. Select 'Database' 
4. Choose 'MySQL' (or MariaDB if available)
5. Railway will create a new MySQL database service

## After Database is Created:

Railway will provide connection variables. You need to add them to your web service:

1. Click on your 'cu-fcchat-docker' service
2. Go to 'Variables' tab
3. Add these variables using the values from your new database:

   DB_HOST=<hostname from Railway MySQL service>
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=railway
   DB_USER=<user from Railway>
   DB_PASSWORD=<password from Railway>

## Import Your SQL Data:

Railway's MySQL won't have your phpBB data yet. You'll need to import it:

1. Get database connection details from Railway
2. Use MySQL client locally to import:
   mysql -h <railway-host> -P <port> -u <user> -p<password> railway < db_init/001_phpbb_backup.sql

This will take ~5-10 minutes for the 683MB file.
